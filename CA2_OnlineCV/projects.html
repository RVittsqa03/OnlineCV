		<i><b text align="left">CRIMINAL JUSTICE:     </b><p>I have a major interest in most parts of the criminology aspect and in particular Justice.  I was a Welfare Representative where 
		a family with deafness required my legal representation in which I put a case together and presented this in the Tribunal.  It was a 
		first and only case that we won.  I then decided to study law and did two years of the LLB degree in Law when I lost 
		interest.  I would type letters on behalf of someone, being neutral and unbiased..  This had brought me into the human rights issues and specifically for the 
		elderly people and children.  I love investigating.  I enjoy the CSIs drama as well as the real life caseworks.  It may have stemmed from the fact
		I always wanted to be a detective just like my grandfather.</p><i>

		<i><b text align="right">TRAVEL:     </b><p>My background is mixed.  I have an Irish/Fijian/Chinese/English in my blood which is probably why I love
		travelling.  I really could not pinpoint where my home is.  I have been to places such as Fiji, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Florida, and other smaller 
		European places.  I still hope to do a travel blog someday, but that is a long awaited task.  I have a few bits and pieces that needs to be timelined and 
		verified where they actually came from.  In all my previous work and especially in the NHS I travelled across London to other offices.  I am pretty good with 
		arriving on time.  This may come from making sure I arrive at the airport 3 hours beforehand.  I also like to pick up a few basic languages just to get by.  
		Regarding languages, I can also add some British Sign Language to the list.  One day I plan to go to Bora Bora.</p><i>

		<i><b text align="left">MUSIC AND OUTDOORS:     </b><p>I used to play a violin hence the image and did an entry exam at The Royal College of Music by Kensington Park, London.
		I also used to play a number of others: tin-whistle, etcetera.  I like to enjoy a wide range of music including classical to urban type of music.  Dancing has
		always been a passion of mine.  As a child I attended drama and dancing outside school and performed on stages.  Now I go out socially often and join up
		a number of Meetup groups as a member meeting new people.  I am planning to learn to play the guitar properly. From an outdoors hobby or interest, I flew a plane last year and 
		loved it.  I went on a hot air balloon this year and to date, I am looking into car rally.  Friends say I am mad but I say I am enjoying life.  I have been known to be a risk taker as well as being adventurous.</p><i>
